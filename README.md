# CaptureMe

## Introduction to the problem and the solution

The CaptureMe system addresses the need for real-time image capture and remote monitoring in IoT applications. In many security, surveillance, and automation systems, capturing and processing images is vital. Traditional methods often involve bulky devices that require manual handling and lack seamless integration with cloud services. The solution to this problem is the development of a compact, cost-effective, and reliable system using ESP32-based modules, enabling image capture, processing, and transmission over Wi-Fi. This solution simplifies the process of accessing real-time images, reducing the need for manual monitoring and providing a convenient, centralized method of remote image viewing. The integration of cloud services further enhances the system by providing a platform for data storage, analysis, and user notifications.
## Hardware design and implementation details

The hardware design of the CaptureMe system revolves around the use of two key components: the ESP32-CAM AI Thinker module and the ESP32-S3 N16R8. The ESP32-CAM AI Thinker serves as the core image capture unit, utilizing its integrated camera to capture images of the environment. The ESP32-S3 N16R8 acts as the central processing unit, handling data received from the camera and performing necessary computations, such as image processing and detection. The system is designed to capture images, process them, store them in a database, and send notifications to users through a mobile application such as Blynk.

The camera module communicates with the ESP32 through a set of GPIO pins, which handle the image data and control signals. The ESP32-S3 processes the captured images and communicates with the cloud database to store relevant information such as image metadata and detection results. Blynk, a user-friendly mobile app, is integrated to provide real-time notifications and allow users to interact with the system easily.
## Software implementation details

The software for the CaptureMe system is designed using the Arduino framework for the ESP32. The main goal is to establish seamless communication between the ESP32-CAM and the ESP32-S3, enabling image capture and remote transmission over Wi-Fi. The system allows for the capture of images, streaming to a web interface, and camera control functionalities (like flash control).

The ESP32 establishes a Wi-Fi connection using predefined SSID and password credentials. Once connected, the camera module is initialized, and a web server is activated to stream images from the camera. The camera uses the OV2640 sensor to capture images, and the ESP32 manages the communication between the camera and the Wi-Fi network. The system also provides basic flash control, where users can toggle the flash on and off, depending on environmental lighting conditions.

The software allows for customization of the camera’s settings, including brightness, saturation, and resolution. The captured images are served over a web interface, where users can view the images by entering the ESP32's IP address into a web browser. The control of the flash and other camera settings is achieved through GPIO pins on the ESP32, with the flash being toggled by a specific function in the code. The system also has room for future enhancements, such as adding motion detection, live video streaming, and user authentication for better security.
## Test results and performance evaluation

Testing of the CaptureMe system was performed to assess its functionality and reliability in real-world scenarios. The primary tests included checking the camera's image capture capability, the system's Wi-Fi connectivity, the effectiveness of the flash control, and the overall performance of the web interface. During testing, the ESP32-CAM successfully captured high-quality images with minimal latency, and the Wi-Fi connection was stable for real-time streaming. The system’s ability to toggle the flash was also tested under different lighting conditions, ensuring optimal image quality.

In terms of performance, the system demonstrated low power consumption and efficient use of resources, allowing continuous image capture and streaming without significant delays. The server was able to handle multiple requests from users, and the image quality was consistent throughout the tests. However, some limitations were observed with higher resolution images, where the system could experience occasional delays or reduced frame rates. This was attributed to the limitations of the ESP32's processing power and memory capacity, but the system performed well for typical use cases.
## Conclusion and future work

In conclusion, the CaptureMe system successfully integrates hardware and software components to provide a compact and efficient solution for image capture and remote monitoring. The system meets its primary objectives by allowing real-time image viewing and offering basic camera controls over a Wi-Fi network. The integration with cloud services ensures that captured data is stored securely and is easily accessible for future analysis.

Future work on the CaptureMe system could include several enhancements. These include implementing motion detection to capture images only when necessary, adding live video streaming capabilities for real-time monitoring, and implementing user authentication for secure access to the web interface. Additionally, more robust error handling and system diagnostics could be added to ensure reliability in diverse environmental conditions. Further testing in different use cases, including outdoor and low-light environments, would help optimize the system for broader applications.
